## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, other OS are experimental
- Node.js 18+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- Python 3.12+ ([download](https://www.python.org/))
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA

## Quick Start (Windows)

1. **Extract** the [ZIP file](https://github.com/ihatecsv/deepseek-ocr-client/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. **Run** `start-client.bat`
   - First run will automatically install dependencies.
   - Subsequent runs will start quicker.
3. **Load Model** - Click the "Load Model" button in the app, this will download or load the model.
   - If this is the first run, this might take some time.
4. **Drop an image** or click the drop zone to select one.
5. **Run OCR** - Click "Run OCR" to process.

Note: if you have issues processing images but the model loads properly, please close and re-open the app and try with the default resolution for "base" and "size". This is a [known issue](https://github.com/ihatecsv/deepseek-ocr-client/issues/2), if you can help to fix it I would appreciate it!

## Linux/macOS

**Note:** Linux and macOS have not been tested yet. Use `start-client.sh` instead of `start-client.bat`.

**PRs welcome!** If you test on Linux/macOS and encounter issues, please open a pull request with fixes.
